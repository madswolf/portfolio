## Summary

The Crane game machine was built as a part of the How To Make Almost Anything Course at ITU.
The course was about learning 3D modeling, mechatronics, designing mechanisms and many other skills that are relevant to prototyping and robotics.

I learned a ton about electromechanical engineering from this project and it reallysparked my interest in mechanics, robotics, and prototyping.

The final product is very rough and is mostly assembled with extruded aluminium, but the mechanisms we designed were either laser cut or 3D printed and worked very well.
