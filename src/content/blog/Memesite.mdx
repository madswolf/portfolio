## Summary

MemeSite is a website for generating random memes using components from user-submitted content. 
Users can upload memes in three parts: a picture, top text, and bottom text. 
These components are stored in a PostgreSQL database.

Originally, MemeSite was a project to explore Python and Flask. 
However, it quickly evolved into a way to experiment with TypeScript, Node.js, and React. 
For the backend API, I utilized PostgreSQL, TypeORM, TypeScript, and Express. 
The frontend was built with React and TypeScript.

As an early project in my programming journey, MemeSite taught me a lot but also included many mistakes. 
This experience led me to rewrite the backend in C# using EF Core, which can be found <a href="/projects/memeapi">here</a>.

The projects code can be found [here](https://github.com/madswolf/memefrontend).

## Extras
I also made an integration with a minecraft mod called computercraft where a meme from the site would be rendered in game on some monitors:

This integration was written in lua on the in game terminal, and i was unfortunate enough to lose this world, so the code is lost to time.
