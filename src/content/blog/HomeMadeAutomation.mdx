## Summary

This project is about my exploration of IOT and Smart home technologies through automating or smartifying parts of my home.
The project does not make use of common tools like HomeAssistant as i wanted to create my own logic for the automation and learn a few things along the way. 

The project is mainly interacted with through a python API that exposes commands for different parts of the home, like lights, TV, Speakers.
This API was mainly used by myself to use my phone as a universal remote by issuing commands from it, but there were also logic for automatically turning light on and off when i left or came home.

During the project i learned about different communication technologies like bluetooth, Infrared, ZigBee and LoRaWAN.

## Extras
During the Covid19 pandemic i also implemented features relating to playing sounds through a smartified speaker.
This allowed my friends to send messages that were spoken through the speaker with TTS to say hello or remind me of something.
More often than not, this API was actually used to annoy or surprise me, hence the name Clown API. 
A lot of shenanigans were pulled with that API, but it was all in good fun.
