## Summary

This website is for generating random memes based on components from user submitted memes.
The site lets users upload memes in three parts, a picture, a toptext, and a bottom text. All these parts gets stored in a postgresql database.

This project was originally a project to try out python and flask but it very quickly became a project for me to try out Typescript, Node.js, and React.
I used Postgresql for the database and technologies like Typeorm Typescript, and Express for the backend api, and finally i used React and Typescript for the frontent.
The project created very early in my studies, which means i learned a lot, but i also made mistakes. Which is why i later remade the backend in C# and EF-core. That project can be found [here](https://madswolf.dk/projects/memeapi).

The projects code can be found [here](https://github.com/madswolf/memefrontend).

## Extras
I also made an integration with a minecraft mod called computercraft where a meme from the site would be rendered in game on some monitors:
<img width={1020} height={510} src="/minecraftmeme.png"/>

This integration was written in lua on the in game terminal, and i was unfortunate enough to lose this world, so the code is lost to time.
