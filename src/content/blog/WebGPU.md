## Summary
The website is a Rust WebGPU rendering engine that is currently following the [learn WebGPU tutorial](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/).
I have already used OpenGL in another project, so seeing the ease of use of WebGPU is a real treat.
I have not gotten very far on this project, but i will likely get back into it soon.

## Links

The projects code can be found [here](https://www.github.com/madswolf/rust_webgpu) and a live version of the site can be found [here](https://webgpu.madswolf.dk/).
