## Summary

This project is a collection of solutions to programming problems found on the website Kattis.
These problems centre around using knowledge of algorithms and data structures to solve these challenge within the time and space limit.

This project really solidified many of the algorithmic knowledge gained from my courses, along with being a great way to learn and try out new programming languages.
