## Summary

This project was a part of the Advanced Robotics course on ITU. We used the Thymio robot platform to detect other robots with computer vision and created a simulation for the learning algorithm.
The learning algorithm did not use any traditional machine learning library, so the entire project was written by us.

Here is a visualization of the simulation for one of the generations groups.

The projects code can be found [here](https://github.com/madswolf/Advanced_robotics).
The project only runs on a thymio robot, so there is no live version to demo.
