## Summary

This project was a discord bot to interact with the [Memesite](https://madswolf.dk/projects/memesite).
It allowed users to both upload memes with a command, and fetch a randomized meme based on a seed.
The randomization included many different possible operations, like mirroring the original image, turning up the saturation, pixelating the image, increaing noise, and finally an integrating with one of my friend's projects where a random face was generated based on a seed. His project can be found [here](https://tobloef.com/projects?project=face-generator).

## Links

The projects code can be found [here](https://www.github.com/madswolf/memebot), and since the bot runs on a discord server i cannot link to a live version.
