This was a project about using functional programming to implement a Scrabble bot that would compete with other students' bots.
To be able to compete with other bots, it was important to take care to optimize the bot for optimal performance, as there were penalties for being too slow.

This project was a nice and crisp challenge, learning functional programming really changed my approach to programming.

This is a full length game between my bot and the teachers bot
