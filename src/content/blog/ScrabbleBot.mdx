This was a project about using functional programming to implement a Scrabble bot that would compete with other students' bots.
To be able to compete with other bots, it was important to take care to optimize the bot for optimal performance, as there were penalties for being too slow.

This project was a nice and crisp challenge, learning functional programming really changed my approach to programming.

I learned a lot of concepts like:
- Match statements
- Pure functions
- Immutability
- Tail recursion

I really think that these concepts have impacted my approach to coding.
Both in terms of how i view how code should be structured, but also in what ways i can apply these concepts to hopelly simply code even in OOP paradigms.
