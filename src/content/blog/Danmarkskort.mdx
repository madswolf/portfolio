## Summary

The Danmarkskort project was my first major application during my first year at ITU, providing a wealth of learning experiences.

Developed in Java with JavaFX, the application uses data from OpenStreetMap, which we parsed into a KD-tree for rendering and a di-graph with A* for pathfinding. This project taught me a lot about application development, including collaborating with other developers, organizing code, implementing algorithms and data structures, and optimizing memory and processing time.
Aside from writing code, my role also ended up being integrating everyone's changes to make them work together and assigning bug-fixing tasks. 
This project was also my introduction to git, where i quickly learned that having a unified workflow for merging changes is very important.

The final product is a little rough around the edges, but a short demo can be seen here:
