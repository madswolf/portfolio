## Summary

The Danmarkskort project was the first year project on ITU and it was also my first major application.

The application is written in Java and used data from OpenStreetMap, parsed it a KD-tree for rendering and a di-graph with A* for pathfinding.
I learned a lot during this project about how to develop an application like working with other developers, organizing code, algorithms and datastructures, leading a small team, and optimizing memory and processing time.

The final product is a little rough around the edges, but a short demo can be seen here:
