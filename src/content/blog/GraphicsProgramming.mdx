## Summary

This project was a part of my Graphics Programming course where i learned about rendering through OpenGL.

The projects goal was to implement Parallax Occlusion Mapping, a technique similar to normal mapping, where light is bent differently by a flat surface to imitate real depth when the object is in reality flat.
The new technique is to acutally let parts of the texture occlude other parts based on the viewpoint and to similarly occlude/block light from nearby lightsources.

The project and the course itself taught me a lot about rendering graphics and the rendering pipeline, and also how weird results you get when you mess up even the smallest things.

This video demo shows three different textures to show off shader and how you need to tune it a little:
