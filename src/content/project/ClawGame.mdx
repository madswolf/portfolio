## Summary
The crane game machine was constructed as part of the "How to Make Almost Anything" course at ITU. 
This course focused on teaching 3D modeling, mechatronics, mechanism design, and various other skills pertinent to prototyping and robotics.

Through this project, I gained substantial knowledge in electromechanical engineering, 
which significantly heightened my interest in mechanics, robotics, and prototyping.

Although the final product is somewhat rudimentary and primarily assembled with extruded aluminum,
the mechanisms we designed were either laser-cut or 3D-printed and functioned really well.
