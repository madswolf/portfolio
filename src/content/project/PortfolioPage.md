## Summary

This very page!

The page is written in Typescript with Astro, Markdown and MDX.
The goal was to make a simple and clean page that would be easy to udate and maintain in the future.

This project brought me a lot of joy, but also some headaches.
As i scrounged through old projects i would re-experience the joy those projects brought me, along with the burden of making the older projects work many years after creation.
