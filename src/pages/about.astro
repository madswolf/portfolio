I am Mads Wolf Jespersen, a software developer for <a href="https://www.dalux.com/">Dalux</a>, but by night, I tinker with everything from IoT and robotics to React and WebGPU in projects that can be found in my <a href="/projects">portfolio</a>.
On this page, there is a bit more detailed information about me, such as my CV, interests, and other miscellaneous info.
<br/>
<br/>

I studied software development at the IT University of Copenhagen, where I specialized in robotics. I love the electromechanical parts of robotics, as well as the designing and 3D modeling. 
This ended up becoming a big hobby of mine with a 3D printer, where I design everything from macro keyboards to minor electromechanical machines to automate tasks.
<br/>
<br/>

Even though I specialized in robotics, I also took courses on DevOps and graphics programming, which are also big interests of mine. 
DevOps is mostly something I explore at my job, but also in my project <a href="/projects/memeapi">MemeApi</a> where I run a pseudo Reddit clone. 
Graphics programming is something I explore in one of my courses, where I implemented <a href="/projects/graphicsprogramming/">Parallax Occlusion Mapping</a>, and in a Rust-based project with <a href="/projects/webgpu/">WebGPU</a>.
